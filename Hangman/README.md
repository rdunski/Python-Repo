# Robert J Dunski Python Repo

### Hangman game written in *Python3* for Advanced Programming: Python, with 3 difficulties: **easy**, **medium**, and **hard**. 
------
+ Word choices are picked from a text file with 30 different words at random. 
 - Words are then randomly blanked out letter by letter (for easy and medium) and players take their guess
+ Letter count is displayed for words, and underscores _ are shown in place of missing letters
+ Guessing correctly will replace the corresponding blank space
 - If all letters were guessed correctly in the word, the final result is shown and you have the choice to move onto the next word
+ Players can quit at anytime during the game by typing "**exit**" and then "**y**"
+ After every correctly guessed word, a point count will show to keep track of your progress
+ Guessing incorrectly will deduct your total "*loss points*", and you will lose the game after a certain amount of negative loss points
#### Difficulties
------
+ On easy difficulty, 6 wrong guesses loses the game, but wrong guess count is reset after every correctly guessed word
+ On medium difficulty, guess incorrectly 4 times loses the game, and the number of guesses is not reset after every word
+ On ~~nightmare~~ hard difficulty, words are ***always*** completely blanked out at the start, and guessing incorrecty twice will lose the game.
### **Have fun playing!**
