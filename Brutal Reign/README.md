###**Brutal Reign**

Hack-and-slash 2D platformer inspired by Metroidvania-like games, made using the Kivy cross-platform Python framework. 
Main attacks centered around hammer-based motions. Secondary abilities that are pickup based and allow access to better loot, different combo moves, and unique movement. 
Optional story elements, but mainly focused on carnage. Rudimentary character customization with multiple genders/color palettes.
